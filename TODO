-1. parse the HYG database csv- (DONE)
2. pick a spatial datastructure to keep the data in (octree? r-tree?)
  -- perhaps consider each point to be a path down an octree and store the
     paths in a trie?
3. project onto various 2D planes, for fun
4. get a WebGL context and try plotting there

Will I be able to load the data incrementally, as (eg) an observer moves through it?

It would be nice to get a generator for larger synthetic datasets to check that the data can be processed reasonably incrementally.
